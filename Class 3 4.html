        <p><b>Trading</b> is the buying and selling of securities, such as stocks,<br/>
            bonds, currencies and commodities, as opposed to investing,<br/>
            which suggests a buy-and-hold strategy. Trading success depends<br/>

            <h1><q>scalping</q></h1>
            <p>Scalping is the most short-term form of trading. Scalp traders only hold positions open for seconds or minutes at most. These short-lived trades<br/>
                target small intraday price movements. The purpose is to make lots of quick trades with smaller profit gains, but let profits accumulate throughout the day due to the<br/>
                sheer number of trades being executed in each trading session.<br/>
                This style of trading requires tight spreads and liquid markets As a result, scalpers tend to trade major currency pairs only<br/>
                (due to liquidity and high trading volume), such as EURUSD, GBPUSD, and USDJPY.<br/>
                They also tend to trade only the busiest times of the trading day during the overlap of trading sessions when there is more trading volume,<br/>
                and often volatility. Scalpers look for the tightest spreads possible, simply because they enter the market so frequently, so paying<br/>
                a wider spread will eat into potential profits.</p>
            <p id="day trading"></p>
            <h1><q>day trading</q></h1>
            <p>Day traders enter and exit their positions on the same day (unlike swing and position traders), removing the risk of any large overnight moves.<br/>
                At the end of the day, they close their position with either a profit or a loss. Trades are usually held for a period of minutes or hours,<br/>
                and as a result, require sufficient time to analyse the markets and frequently monitor positions throughout the day. Just like scalp traders,<br/>
                day traders rely on frequent small gains to build profits.</p>
                <p id="swing trading"></p>
                <h1><q>swing trading</q></h1>
                <p>Unlike day traders who hold positions for less than one day, swing traders typically hold positions for several days, although sometimes<br/>
                as long as a few weeks. Because positions are held over a period of time, to capture short-term market moves, traders do not need to sit<br/>
                constantly monitoring the charts and their trades throughout the day.
                This makes it a popular trading style for those who have other commitments (such as a full-time job) and would like to trade in their leisure time.<br/>
                However, it is still necessary to dedicate a few hours a day to analyse the markets.</p>
                <p id="position trading"></p>
                <h1><q>position trading</q></h1>
                <p>Position traders are focused on long-term price movement, looking for maximum potential profits to be gained from major shifts in prices. As a result,<br/>
                    trades generally span over a period of weeks, months or even years. Position traders tend to use weekly and monthly price charts to analyse and evaluate the markets,<br/>
                    using a combination of technical indicators and fundamental analysis to identify potential entry and exit levels.</p><hr/>
