      He was the eldest of seven children of Jinnahbhai Poonja, a prosperous
      merchant, and his wife,<br />
      Mithibai. His family was a member of the
      <a href="./Khoja caste.html">Khoja Caste</a>, Hindus who had converted to
      Islam<br />
      centuries earlier and who were followers of the Aga Khan. There is some
      question about Jinnahs date of birth:<br />
      although he maintained that it was December 25, 1876, school records from
      Karachi (Pakistan) give a date of October 20, 1875. After being taught at
      home, Jinnah was sent in 1887 to the Sind Madrasat al-Islam<br />
      (now Sindh Madressatul Islam University) in Karachi. Later he attended the
      Christian Missionary Society High School<br />
      (also in Karachi), where at the age of 16 he passed the matriculation
      examination of the University<br />
      of Bombay (now University of Mumbai, in Mumbai, India). On the advice of
      an English friend,<br />
      his father decided to send him to England to acquire business experience.
      Jinnah, however, had made up<br />
      his mind to become a barrister. In keeping with the custom of the time,
      his parents<br />
      arranged for an early marriage for him before he left for England. In
      London he joined Lincolns Inn, one of the legal societies that prepared
      students for the bar.<br />
      <p style="text-align: left">
        In 1895, at the age of 19, he was called to the bar. While in London
        Jinnah<br />
        suffered two severe bereavements—the deaths of his wife and his mother.
        Nevertheless, he completed his formal studies<br />
        and also made a study of the British political system, frequently
        visiting the House of Commons.<br />
        He was greatly influenced by the liberalism of William E. Gladstone, who
        had become prime minister for the<br />
        fourth time in 1892, the year of Jinnahs arrival in London. Jinnah also
        took a keen interest<br />
        in the affairs of India and in Indian students. When the Parsi leader
        Dadabhai Naoroji,<br />
        a leading Indian nationalist, ran for the British Parliament, Jinnah and
        other Indian students worked<br />
        day and night for him. Their efforts were crowned with success: Naoroji
        became the first Indian to sit in the House of Commons. When Jinnah
        returned to Karachi in 1896, he found that his fathers business had
        suffered losses and that he now had to<br />
        depend on himself. He decided to start his legal practice in Bombay (now
        Mumbai), but it took him years of work to establish himself as a lawyer.

        Jinnah first entered politics by participating in the 1906 session of
        the Indian National Congress (Congress Party) held at Calcutta (now
        Kolkata),<br />
        in which the party began to split between those calling for dominion
        status and those advocating independence for India. Four years later<br />
        he was elected to the Imperial Legislative Council—the beginning of a
        long and distinguished parliamentary career. In Bombay he came to
        know,<br />
        among other important Congress Party personalities, Gopal Krishna
        Gokhale, the eminent Maratha leader. Greatly influenced by those
        nationalist politicians, Jinnah aspired during<br />
        the early part of his political life to become “a Muslim Gokhale.”
        Admiration for British political institutions and an eagerness to
        raise<br />
        the status of India in the international community and to develop a
        sense of Indian nationhood among the peoples of India were<br />
        the chief elements of his politics. At that time, he still looked upon
        Muslim interests in the context of Indian nationalism.<br />
        But, by the beginning of the 20th century, the conviction had been
        growing among the Muslims that their interests demanded the
        preservation<br />
        of their separate identity rather than amalgamation in the Indian nation
        that would for all practical purposes be Hindu. Largely to<br />
        safeguard Muslim interests, the All-India Muslim League was founded in
        1906. But Jinnah remained aloof from it. Only in 1913,<br />
        when authoritatively assured that the league was as devoted as the
        Congress Party to the political emancipation of India, did Jinnah join
        the league.<br />
        When the Indian Home Rule League was formed, he became its chief
        organizer in Bombay and was elected president of the Bombay branch.
